Titanic Survival Prediction Model
This repository contains a machine learning model built to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the Titanic dataset. The model preprocesses data with imputation, encoding, and scaling, then trains a Random Forest Classifier for high accuracy. Model evaluation includes accuracy score metrics to assess performance.

Technologies: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
